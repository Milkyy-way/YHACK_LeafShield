Sustain the Leaf, Empower the Farmer: Cultivating Sustainable Futures

LeafShield is dedicated to gardeners and farmers who are busy with their work and have limited scientific knowledge about crop disease. They are, meanwhile, really in need of a quick solution to detect their cropâ€™s state just by a SCAN and DETECT with a very high confidence level. 

For the time being, LeafShield is available in both mobile app and web app, which is flexible and accessible to use. We now focus on analyzing tomato leaves and displaying up to 98% detection confidence level to prove their potential in analyzing more types of leaves in the future with larger datasets and more time (and money).
